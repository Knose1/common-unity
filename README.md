# Knose1's common repository

In this repository, you can find my tools and utils class.  
All my code is licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE).  
***You're not allowed to change the namespace of my files.***  
  
If you're using any of my tools or utils.  
Feel free to share your work in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/Knose1/common-unity/discussions).  
If you have any questions or problems with a tool / util. Don't hesitate to create a post in the discussion tab.  
  
Also, this is not a collaborative project: it's just a dump of tools / utils I coded.  
That means that any pull request will be dismissed.  
Of course, tips and help are welcomed in the issues and discussion tab.
